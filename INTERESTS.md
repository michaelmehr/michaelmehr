### Software Development
  - Frontend web development and game development are what I lean towards, but I find all forms of development interesting and worth exploring
    Art
  - Graphite pencil drawing/sketching
  - Coloring with colored pencils
  - Graphic design (logos, prints, web design, clothing, stickers)
### Music
  - I love listening to music and exploring all varieties that the world has to offer, whether it's new pop music, underground experimental sounds, or any era of classical
  - I also played the trombone for over a decade, playing in wind ensembles throughout my schooling. Other instruments I have less experience with are drum kit and piano
### Gaming
  - Unsurprisingly, my interest in game development stems from the games I enjoy
  - Genres I enjoy are platformers, arcade/retro shooters, metroidvanias, action RPGs, puzzle games, and rhythm games
  - Some of my favorites:
    - Devil May Cry 5
    - DOOM 2
    - Paper Mario and The Thousand Year Door
    - Legend of Grimrock 2
    - NIER (original on PS3)
    - Super Metroid
    - SUDOKU
    - Metal Gear Solid 3
    - Sound Voltex
### Misc.
  - Critically engaging with media I consume is always a joy, whether its movies, games, art, music, or books
  - The 'Weird', whether that's weird fiction or esotericism. Esotericism is a newer interest of mine, specifically I find the history of the occult and other esoteric practices/philosophies super interesting from a scholarly perspective, and not necessarily something I intend to practice myself
