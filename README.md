## About me

Hello! My name is Michael Mehr, but friends tend to call me Mike. I consider myself a creative person, and I view software development as an artistic medium not unlike painting or writing. These days, I enjoy working with vanilla JS with HTML/CSS and more recently React.js to construct web designs and functional experiences. Beyond web development, I can also be found developing 2D games using GameMaker Studio 2.

## What I'm doing right now

- As a student, my primary responsibility right now is performing well in my studies. This semester I am studying algorithms and network security.

- In my free time, I'm teaching myself React and making a handful of projects to feel more comfortable using the framework.

- I am making a website for [my partner](https://fraxiom-music.netlify.app/) to showcase their music, tour dates, and merch.

- I'm taking part in the [KAIJUJAM](https://itch.io/jam/kaijujam) with a friend, using GameMaker Studio 2.
