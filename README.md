# Hi!

## Michael Mehr

- he/him
- Frontend Web Developer (HTML/CSS/JS/React)
- Game Developer (GameMaker Studio 2)
- Chicago, IL
- Studying Computer Science @ Loyola University Chicago

## Background

Hello! My name is Michael Mehr, but friends tend to call me Mike. I consider myself a creative person, and I view software development as an artistic medium not unlike painting or writing. These days, I enjoy working with vanilla JS with HTML/CSS and more recently React.js to construct web designs and functional experiences. Beyond web development, I can also be found developing 2D games using GameMaker Studio 2.

## Skills

### Frontend Web Development

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- SASS/SCSS
- npm
- React.js

### Game Development

- GameMaker Studio 2 (GMS2)
- GameMaker Language (GML)

### Other Technologies

- Git CLI

### Language-Agnostic/Soft Skills

- Data Structures & Algorithms
  - As a student, I have studied and applied DSA concepts in my classwork and have come to an understanding of the benefits and use cases for them.
- Problem Solving
  - I love approaching problems from every available angle and exploring as many solutions as I can.
- Adaptability
  - Similar to my affinity for problem solving, I approach unfamilliar technologies and workflows as opportunities to learn and broaden my skills to be more universal
- Teamwork
  - I primarily work alone in my personal projects, but I also value teamwork in larger-scale applications. Teams provide more perspectives to solving problems, complex ideas that can be built off of each other, and unique sets of eyes to parse code and recognize errors.
- Design
  - Growing up I spent a significant portion of my time exploring art, whether that's traditional art, digital art, or graphic design.
  - Experimenting with art has allowed me to consider and explore what makes a design look 'good' while occasionally studying graphic design principles for personal work.
- Helpfulness
  - One of my greatest joys is helping others and getting smiles in return. Even in scenarios where I don't fully know how to approach a problem, I like to contribute ideas and participate in exploring solutions alongside others.

### What I Want to Learn

- Other JavaScript frameworks, such as Vue and Angular
- E-Commerce
  - I have contributed a small amount to the CSS of my friend's Shopify storefront, and I hope to eventually create a storefront from scratch for them to use, or to even publish as a theme.

### Interests

- Software Development
  - Frontend web development and game development are what I lean towards, but I find all forms of development interesting and worth exploring
- Art
  - Graphite pencil drawing/sketching
  - Coloring with colored pencils
  - Graphic design (logos, prints, web design, clothing, stickers)
- Music
  - I love listening to music and exploring all varieties that the world has to offer, whether it's new pop music, underground experimental sounds, or any era of classical
  - I also played the trombone for over a decade, playing in wind ensembles throughout my schooling. Other instruments I have less experience with are drum kit and piano
- Gaming
  - Unsurprisingly, my interest in game development stems from the games I enjoy
  - Genres I enjoy are platformers, arcade/retro shooters, metroidvanias, action RPGs, puzzle games, and rhythm games
  - Some of my favorites:
    - Devil May Cry 5
    - DOOM 2
    - Paper Mario and The Thousand Year Door
    - Legend of Grimrock 2
    - NIER (original on PS3)
    - Super Metroid
    - SUDOKU
    - Metal Gear Solid 3
    - Sound Voltex
- Misc.
  - Critically engaging with media I consume is always a joy, whether its movies, games, art, music, or books
  - The 'Weird', whether that's weird fiction or esotericism. Esotericism is a newer interest of mine, specifically I find the history of the occult and other esoteric practices/philosophies super interesting from a scholarly perspective, and not necessarily something I intend to practice myself
