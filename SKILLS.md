## Language-Agnostic/Soft Skills

- Data Structures & Algorithms
  - As a student, I have studied and applied DSA concepts in my classwork and have come to an understanding of the benefits and use cases for them.
- Problem Solving
  - I love approaching problems from every available angle and exploring as many solutions as I can.
- Adaptability
  - Similar to my affinity for problem solving, I approach unfamilliar technologies and workflows as opportunities to learn and broaden my skills to be more universal
- Teamwork
  - I primarily work alone in my personal projects, but I also value teamwork in larger-scale applications. Teams provide more perspectives to solving problems, complex ideas that can be built off of each other, and unique sets of eyes to parse code and recognize errors.
- Design
  - Growing up I spent a significant portion of my time exploring art, whether that's traditional art, digital art, or graphic design.
  - Experimenting with art has allowed me to consider and explore what makes a design look 'good' while occasionally studying graphic design principles for personal work.
- Helpfulness
  - One of my greatest joys is helping others and getting smiles in return. Even in scenarios where I don't fully know how to approach a problem, I like to contribute ideas and participate in exploring solutions alongside others.
